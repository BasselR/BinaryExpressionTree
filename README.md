# BinaryExpressionTree
This program has functions that create and use binary trees to represent mathematical expressions.

These functions have been fully developed and optimized so that they have no memory leaks.

The program allows you to:

- Create nodes
- Combine nodes using mathematical operations
- Evaluate the binary tree so that the root node contains the top-level expression
- Duplicate the binary tree
- Print the bianry tree
- Free the binary tree

A header file is included, which outlines the Node struct. 

A main function has also been provided, containing a sample expression tree.
